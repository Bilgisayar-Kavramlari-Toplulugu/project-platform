This document is a guide for development processes, standards, and workflows in the BKT Platform Project project.

## Workflow

1.  **Issues:** All work (new features, bugs, tasks) should be tracked through GitHub Issues. An issue should be created for each piece of work.
2.  **Branches:** A new feature branch should be created from the `main` branch for each issue. Branch naming convention: `feature/issue-no-short-description` (e.g., `feature/123-add-user-login`).
3.  **Pull Requests (PRs):** All code changes must be merged into the `main` branch through PRs. When opening a PR, reference the related issue (`Task Ticket Number #123`).
4.  **Code Review:** Each PR must be approved by the project lead or at least one designated senior developer.

## Coding Standards

- Follow the coding standards and linting rules defined in each repository.
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Write tests for newly added or modified features.
- Update the documentation (README, Wiki, etc.) related to your changes.

## Getting Started

- **Prerequisites:**
  - Git must be installed on your local machine.
  - You must have access permissions to the project repositories.
- **Setup:**
  - Clone the relevant repository.
  - Follow the setup steps in the repository's `README.md` file.
  - Review the "initial setup issue" assigned to you for your first tasks.
